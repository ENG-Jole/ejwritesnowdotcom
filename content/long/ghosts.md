Maggie is not over her ex, Cait—her first love who cheated on her at a party and vanished without a trace the next day just months before they were to get married. That was five years ago. Now, Maggie pretends to be content with her life: a one bedroom apartment in a gayborhood, a not-terrible bartending job, and a long list of messages from lovers she never responded to. But when Cait mysteriously appears for minutes at a time, Maggie suspects there’s a macabre reason she never heard back from her, one which threatens to lift the veil on the stability she’s scrounged together.
