Like Mitski,\
I am your Best American Girl,  
Crying in front of the washing machine  
From a parsec away.  
  
A New Career in a New Town  
But realizing that there's  
No real way to retire from sad  
Next to the burnt pages of unwritten memoirs.  
  
Resonance  
From the roots peaking out of the sidewalk  
And the snow dusting the sourdough  
Chills running down my back like a sea breeze  
  
Immunity  
Is still a far off concept a dream from the land of Nod  
But I am a new woman and one day  
I won't give a damn about the 405
