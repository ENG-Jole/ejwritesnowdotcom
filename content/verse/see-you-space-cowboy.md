See you space cowboy,\
roped into\
something that\
you thought you'd\
never\
find
  
Another awesome\
and terrible\
milquetoast\
majesty\
of the depths\
of the universe itself
  
See you space cowboy,\
You left me long behind\
when the game turned\
the tables twisted\
and I no longer had\
sympathy for the devil

Those with wealth and taste\
rhapsodic in nature\
self contained\
explosives and\
butterflies you know you've got to\
carry that weight

See you space cowboy\
where's your messiah now?\
you drifted off into the solar system\
but I'm right here\
not good enough\
only good enough betray

We're both gone\
in the same direction\
lightyears apart\
you found yours and I know\
it will crash\
but you can't come back to me
  
See you space cowboy\
I'm free now\
and I found Julia\
just another bend in the road\
you made your choice\
and I made mine
